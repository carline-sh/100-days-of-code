# The Little Song That Wouldn't Stop

Sometimes a tune sneaks up on you — not the kind that blares from speakers, but the small, sticky melody that lives in the corners of your day. I found one of those this morning in the hum of the kettle: three notes, bright and persistent, like a tiny brass band with a caffeine habit. I couldn't help smiling.

What I love about music is how honest it is without trying. A two-chord loop can confess loneliness; a drum fill can throw a party. Today’s loop turned my coffee routine into a film score. For ten minutes I was a protagonist striding down the pavement, even though I was really just late for a meeting.

If you want to catch one of these moments, put your phone away for five minutes and listen — not to fill the silence, but to meet it. You might hear a neighbor’s rhythm, the careful tempo of footsteps, or a melody born of a squeaky gate. Music isn’t only for concerts; it’s stitched into the mundane, waiting to be noticed.

So, here's to small songs: the elevator hums, the whistle in a bus line, the melody you whistle wrong but keep anyway. They’re proof that soundtrack is a mindset. Today, I learned that a kettle can be a composer — and I’m glad it decided to write me a tiny anthem.

— M.
