# 100 days of code


## Day 1

### Making a repo

First make a repo on github and then clone it. This saves you from extra setup.

### Cloning a repo 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:carline824/100-days-of-code.git
```

### Making a commit

Checking where we are at (which files have changed) (aka what we are about to commit)

```sh
git status
```

Adding ("staging") all files in the folder (`.` = this folder)

```sh
git add .
```

Make a new commit with the name "make navbar cool"

```sh
git commit -m "make navbar cool"
```
